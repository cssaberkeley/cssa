  <h3>Nora Harhen</h3>
  <div class="thesis-info">
    <p class="thesis-info-txt">Major(s): Cognitive Science
      <br>
      Graduated: 2018
      <br>
      Started Thesis: Technically, I started summer 2018, but it was a continuation of a project I had been working on since February 2016.
      <br>
      Thesis Title: The Influence of Goal Setting on Value Learning: Examining how Goal-directed Behavior leverages the Reinforcement Learning System
      <br>
      Thesis Advisor: Anne Collins, Linda Wilbrecht (Second Reader)
      <br>
      Thesis Summary: People are able to generate intrinsically-defined rewards that drive choice similar to extrinsic reward. However, these intrinsically-defined rewards drive learning differently from extrinsic reward.
      <br>
      Tip for Students Writing a Thesis: 1) If you think you might want to do a career in research, 100% do it. It'll give you an answer very quickly whether or not you want to pursue it. 2) If you can, try to take as few classes as possible your last semester while you're finishing up your thesis. It's really nice to be able to spend over 20 hours a week on it and not have to worry about also juggling 4 to 5 classes. 3) Meet with your advisor as often as possible and ask for advice from your second reader. I didn't use my second reader at all, but retrospectively, I think she would have been happy to give me advice that would've improved the quality of my thesis. 5) Come May, you'll hate your thesis and will never want to talk about it again because it is a piece of flaming garbage, but wait a couple of months and you'll come to like discussing it again. 6) Literally, no one is done in time for the Glushko prize, so just submit something no matter what state your thesis is in. So few people apply because it's an early deadline and they think everyone else has their shit together. No one has their shit together. Just submit it.

     Thesis Title: The Effects of Aging and Cognitive Tutoring on Planning Abilities
      <br>
     Thesis Advisor: Tom Griffiths, Falk Lieder, William Jagust (Second Reader)
      <br>
      Thesis Summary: People's ability to make complex planning decisions is known to deteriorate with age. This work examines the nature of these changes and also examines the effect that cognitive tutoring systems could have in teaching people to plan more effectively. The findings suggest that such systems can help aging decision-makers stay sharp.
      <br>
      Tip for Students Writing a Thesis: Writing a thesis is equivalent to taking two classes to make sure to plan your workload accordingly. Also, it's really really important to have an advisor who can meet with you frequently to give you advice or feedback on your project (especially if you're starting late, like I did). Some professors may not have this kind of time, so don't be afraid to ask a senior graduate student or post-doc to be your co-advisor!
