      <h3 class="conf-info-txt" id="ccsc22-info-text"> The California Cognitive Science Conference at UC Berkeley is an annual all-day symposium bringing together hundreds of students, researchers, and members of the general public from around the world who are passionate about the interdisciplinary field of Cognitive Science for a day of presentations and research presentations. We feature talks given by prominent scientists and thinkers from a wide variety of disciplines, and our acclaimed poster session provides undergraduates with the opportunity to present their original research alongside graduate students and professional researchers.

        The theme for this year's annual conference is "Pathways to Purpose: The Cognitive Pursuit of Clarity." Through this event, our speakers will explore perspectives on human purpose amidst the dynamic landscape of our modern world. The conference provides attendees with a glimpse into the latest research in all the fields that comprise Cognitive Science, including but not limited to Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence, Linguistics, Philosophy, and Sociology.</h3>

        <div class="speaker-bio">
          <p>
            Yoona Kang (she/her) is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at Rutgers University – Camden. Kang’s research focuses on how social experiences influence the health of individuals and groups. She examines evidence-based prevention strategies, such as compassion, purpose in life, and mindfulness interventions, and integrate neurocognitive and social network levels of analysis to understand and prevent health risks among diverse populations. She takes multimethod approaches that integrate experimental and behavioral paradigms, computational neuroimaging techniques, ecological momentary assessment, social-network analysis, and natural language processing. She has applied these methods to intertwined dimensions of wellness, including physical activity, alcohol drinking, social connection, and loneliness. Kang received her bachelor’s degree in Psychology from University of California, Los Angeles, and Ph.D. in Cognitive Psychology from Yale University. Post PhD, Kang conducted research as a postdoctoral researcher and research director at the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg School for Communication.

            Anne L. Beatty-Martínez received her Ph.D. in Spanish and Language Science at Penn State University in 2019. She was subsequently an NIH Ruth L. Kirschstein postdoctoral fellow at McGill University. Her research has two intertwined strands: one that examines how cognition supports language use and another that asks how language use impacts cognition itself. At UCSD, she is the director of the Bilingualism in Context Lab which combines ethnographic and experimental approaches, including corpus-based, eye-tracking, and electrophysiological methods, to better understand how the mind and brain adapt to the demands of more than one language.

        <h3 class="speaker-name">Timothy Lomas (Keynote)</h3>

        <div class="speaker-bio">
          <p>
            Tim Lomas, PhD, is a Psychology Research Scientist in the Department of Epidemiology at the
Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and part of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard
University. Tim’s main research focus is exploring cross-cultural perspectives on wellbeing,
especially concepts and practices deemed ‘non-Western.’ Current projects include: assisting with the
Global Flourishing Study, a longitudinal study of 240,000 people in 22 countries; helping lead the
Global Wellbeing Initiative, a collaboration with Gallup to develop and analyse new items for their
World Poll that reflect non-Western views of wellbeing; creating a lexicography and conceptual map
of ‘untranslatable’ words relating to wellbeing; and leading a project funded by the Templeton
Foundation to look into Muslim perspectives on wellbeing. Before entering academia, Tim spent
seven years as a professional musician, while also working part-time as a psychiatric nursing
assistant. Tim completed his PhD at the University of Westminster in 2012, where his thesis focused
on the impact of meditation on men's mental health (combining cognitive neuroscience, narrative, and
ethnographic analysis). From 2013 to 2020 Tim was a lecturer in positive psychology at the
University of East London. Since 2013, Tim has published over 100 papers and 12 books relating to
wellbeing, involving topics/approaches including linguistics, semiotics, art, emotional dialectics,
balance/harmony, systems theory, social theory, politics, gender, and Buddhism. His latest book,
entitled Happiness, was published in 2023 by MIT Press as part of their Essential Knowledge series.
