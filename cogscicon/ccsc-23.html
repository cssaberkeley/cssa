            Martin Hilbert is Professor at the University of California, Davis, where he chairs the campus wide emphasis in Computational Social Sciences. He studies the societal implications of digitalization in complex social systems and has become increasingly concerned about the downsides of digital tech. He holds doctorates in Economic and Social Sciences (2006), and in Communication (2012). His work is recognized in academia for the first study that assessed how much information there is in the world; in public policy for having designed the first digital action plan with the governments of Latin America and the Caribbean at the United Nations; and in the popular media for having alerted about the intervention of Cambridge Analytica in the campaign of Donald Trump a year before the scandal broke. Before he joined academia he served as Economic Affairs Officer of the United Nations Secretariat for 15 years, where he created the Information Society Program for Latin America and the Caribbean. Prof. Hilbert has provided technical assistance in the field of digital development to more than 20 countries and dozens of publicly traded companies as digital strategist. His work has been published in the most recognized academic journals, such as Science, Psychological Bulletin, Trends in Ecology and Evolution, and World Development, and regularly appears in popular magazines, including The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, The Economist, NPR, BBC, Die Welt, among others.

           Robin Queen is an Arthur F. Thurnau Professor of Linguistics, German and English, and currently serves as the chair of the Department of Communication and Media at the University of Michigan, USA. Her research focuses on different strands of sociolinguistics, including language and social cognition; language and identities; language contact, and language as social action. Her 2015 book, Vox Popular: The Surprising Life of Language in the Media (Wiley-Blackwell), explores the many ways that language variation proves integral to the unfolding of fictional audiovisual media. When not acting as an academic, she lives on a small farm with her spouse and a lively band of critters large and small.

          <p>
            Dr. Lindsay Bowman is an Assistant Professor of Psychology at the University of California, Davis, and Principal Investigator of the Brain and Social Cognition (BASC) Lab. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in Developmental Psychology. With experience as a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Maryland Child Development Lab and as a research fellow in the Labs of Cognitive Neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children’s Hospital, her work brings together unique perspectives on neuroscience, cognition, social understanding, and development. Her lab uses a combination of neuroscientific (EEG/ERP) and behavioral methods to understand how cognition develops over infancy and childhood, and how these early developments set the course for social success or impairment. Her most recent work focuses on investigating the neural correlates of social cognition in live-interactive settings, and on how brain development interacts with social experiences in the environment to support emerging complex social behavior.

          Hyowon (Ho) Gweon (she/her) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychology at Stanford University. She has been named as a Richard E.
      Guggenhime Faculty Scholar (2020) and a David Huntington Dean's Faculty Scholar (2019), and currently serves as the Director of Graduate Studies for the Department of Psychology and the Symbolic Systems Program. Hyo received her PhD in Cognitive
      Science (2012) from MIT, where she continued as a postdoc before joining Stanford in 2014. Hyo is broadly interested in how humans learn from others and help others learn. Taking an interdisciplinary approach that combines developmental, computational, and neuroimaging methods, her research aims to explain the cognitive underpinnings of distinctively human learning, communication, and prosocial behaviors. Awards and honors include: CDS Steve Reznick Early Career Award (2022), APS Janet Spence Award for Transformative Early Career Contributions (2020), Jacobs Early Career Fellowship (2020), James S. McDonnell Scholar Award for Human Cognition (2018), APA Dissertation Award (2014), Marr Prize (best student paper, Cognitive Science Society 2010)

        <div class="speaker-bio">
          <p>
            Douglas Guilbeault is an Assistant Professor in the Management of Organizations Group at the Haas School of Business. He studies how communication networks underlie the production and diffusion of cultural content, such as linguistic categories and social norms. This investigation extends to how communication dynamics are shaped by various sources of influence, such as organizational culture, political messaging, and the design of social media platforms. His work on these topics has appeared in a number of top journals, including Nature Communications, The Proceedings of the National Academy of the Sciences, Management Science, and Cognition, as well as in popular news outlets, such as The Atlantic, Wired, and The Harvard Business Review. Guilbeault’s work has received top research awards from The International Conference on Computational Social Science, The Cognitive Science Society, and The International Communication Association. He is faculty co-director of the Berkeley-Stanford Computational Culture Lab, and he is a recent recipient of Stanford's "Art of Science" prize for his piece, "Changing Views in Data Science over 50 Years," produced in collaboration with the research collective, compsyn ("Computational Synesthesia").
