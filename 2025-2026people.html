            <span style="color: #8484FF">Bio:</span> Hi!! My name is Cindy Wang, and I’m a junior double majoring in Data Science and Cognitive Science. I’m especially interested in computational neuroscience, with a focus on neural networks and their connections to Large Language Models. Outside of class, I love traveling to new places, exploring different boba shops and restaurants, and documenting little snapshots of my life along the way.
